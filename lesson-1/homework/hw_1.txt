Power BI Desktop: Build reports locally, free tool, more development-focused.

Power BI Service: Cloud platform to publish, share, and collaborate on reports.

5. What file extension does a Power BI project use?

Tableau Cons: More expensive, steeper learning curve.

12. Explain how Power BI integrates with Azure services.

Azure SQL Database / Synapse → Direct data connection.

Azure Machine Learning → Predictive analytics integration.

Azure Data Lake → Big data storage + Power BI visualization.

13. What are "gateways" in Power BI, and when are they needed?

Data Gateway is a bridge between on-premises data and the Power BI Service.

Needed when connecting local databases (e.g., SQL Server) to cloud reports for scheduled refresh.
